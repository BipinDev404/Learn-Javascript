## JavaScript Comment

JavaScript comments are a meaningful way to deliver messages.  
They are used to **add information** about the code — warnings or suggestions — so that the end-user can easily interpret the code.

JavaScript comments are **ignored by the JavaScript engine**, i.e., they are not executed in the browser.
